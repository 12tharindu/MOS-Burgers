Project Submission
You are required to create a Git Repository on GitHub at the beginning of the project. All updates and changes made to the project should be committed and pushed to the repository regularly. The repository should include all necessary files and assets required to run the website, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and any other multimedia files.

Introduction to Business
“MOS Burgers” is a locally-owned medium-scale business that specializes in selling a wide variety of burgers, submarines, and soft drinks. On an average day, the shop serves between 50-60 customers. Despite its popularity, the current method of handling transaction details and issuing bills relies on manual, paper-based processes. As the number of customers visiting the shop continues to grow daily, there is a need to streamline and modernize these operations.

Project Scope and Requirements
To mitigate the challenges inherent in the manual system, Mr. Nimal Mayadunne aims to establish a digital system that can efficiently handle tasks such as Order Processing, Store Management, Bill Issuing, and Customer Management.

Store Management
User should be able to view all food items.
All food items within the system should be presented to the user categorically.
The list should include the price, quantity on hand, expiration dates for packaged foods, and the unique food item code.
User should be able to update and delete food items.
User should be able to add items to the system.
The system should notify the user about expired food items and allow for the removal of expired items.
Order Management
The system needs to handle placing orders and keeping track of order details.
Users should be able to select food items from the menu by typing the item name, item code, or by category.
All selected or added food items should be displayed in the cart with their respective prices and quantities.
Users should be able to add a discount percentage to the whole order.
Users should be able to view previous orders by searching from customer ID (Contact Number) or by Order ID.
After the order is completed, the system should generate a receipt for the order (generating a PDF is sufficient).
Customer Management
The system should be able to add customers both while placing orders and through a separate process.
Users should be able to update, delete, and edit details of customers.
Users should be able to view orders under each customer name.
Report Generating
The system should be able to generate a monthly report of sales.
Users should be able to view customers with the highest rate of orders within the month.
The system should generate an annual sales report and food items count report.
Deployment
Deploy your web application on GitHub Pages, a free hosting service provided by GitHub. You can easily enable GitHub Pages for your repository, allowing you to host your web application at no cost.
